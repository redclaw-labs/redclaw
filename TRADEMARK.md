## Our Trademarks

The following are trademarks of RedClaw Labs:

- **RedClaw** (word mark)
- **redclaw-labs** (organization name)
- The RedClaw logo and associated visual identity

These marks identify the official RedClaw project and distinguish it from
unauthorized forks, derivatives, or impersonators.

---

## Official Repository

The **only** official RedClaw repository is:

> https://github.com/redclaw-labs/redclaw

Any other repository, organization, domain, or product claiming to be
"RedClaw" or implying affiliation with RedClaw Labs is unauthorized and
may constitute trademark infringement.

**Known unauthorized forks:**
- `openagen/redclaw` — not affiliated with RedClaw Labs

If you encounter an unauthorized use, please report it by opening an issue
at https://github.com/redclaw-labs/redclaw/issues.

## Permitted Uses

You **may** use the RedClaw name and marks in the following ways without
prior written permission:

1. **Attribution** — stating that your software is based on or derived from
   RedClaw, provided it is clear your project is not the official RedClaw.

2. **Descriptive reference** — referring to RedClaw in documentation,
   articles, blog posts, or presentations to accurately describe the software.

3. **Community discussion** — using the name in forums, issues, or social
   media to discuss the project.

4. **Fork identification** — identifying your fork as "a fork of RedClaw"
   with a clear link to the official repository.

---

## Prohibited Uses

You **may not** use the RedClaw name or marks in ways that:

1. **Imply official endorsement** — suggest your project, product, or
   organization is officially affiliated with or endorsed by RedClaw Labs.

2. **Cause brand confusion** — use "RedClaw" as the primary name of a
   competing or derivative product in a way that could confuse users about
   the source.

3. **Impersonate the project** — create repositories, domains, packages,
   or accounts that could be mistaken for the official RedClaw project.

4. **Misrepresent origin** — remove or obscure attribution to RedClaw Labs
   while distributing the software or derivatives.

5. **Commercial trademark use** — use the marks in commercial products,
   services, or marketing without prior written permission from RedClaw Labs.

you fork RedClaw, you must:

- Not imply your fork is the official or original project
- Retain all copyright, license, and attribution notices

## Contributor Protections

Contributors to the official RedClaw repository are protected under the
dual MIT + Apache 2.0 license model:

- **Patent grant** (Apache 2.0) — your contributions are protected from
  patent claims by other contributors.
- **Attribution** — your contributions are permanently recorded in the
  repository history and NOTICE file.
